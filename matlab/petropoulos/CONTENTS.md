# Description
This is a folder that contains petropoulos code for the Melfa robot.


There are:

- **melfaR2006**: contains the basic functions (might be an older version). Contains a melfa_function folder
- **melfa_function**: contains (probably) a newer version to the melfa robot commands
- **RV2A_MATLAB_FUNCTIONS_VER2**: rv2a functions not included but mentioned listed in the dissertation.

# TODO

clarify which version is better and incorporate it in the python version.
